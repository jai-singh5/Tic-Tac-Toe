# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game, a simple and fun project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This is the classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

## Features

- Two-player mode: Play with a friend by taking turns.
- Dynamic game board: Click to place your symbol (X or O) and watch the game logic handle win/draw conditions.
- Responsive design: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Game restart: Reset the game after finishing to play again.

## How to Play

- Player 1 is assigned X, and Player 2 is assigned O.
- Players take turns clicking on the 3x3 grid to place their mark.
- The first player to align three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game results in a draw.
- Press the "Restart" button to start a new game.
